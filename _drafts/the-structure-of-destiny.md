Over the past few weeks I've thinking about why I'm still even playing Destiny. A game that most people say isn't good, yet still play anyway. 

Today I believe I've found my reason. It involves espionage, murder, court intrigue, and 5 years on an unnamed island...

My reason for playing Destiny doesn't involve any of those things. In fact, **spoiler alert**, it isn't a very good reason. I'll lay it out and you can decide if you agree or not.

As I thought about it, I realized that the very core structure of Desinty was under consideration. Maybe that's a good place to start. How do you _do things in Destiny_ and how does that compare to how you _do things in other RPGs_?

## Steps to doing Destiny

Reducing Destiny down to a list of things to do from start to finish is pretty simple (especially after you've put many hours into the game...):

1. Choose a mission
2. Play the mission
3. Something about a Ball of Good, and The Evil Dudes
4. Level up because of the mission
5. Start again at step 1 until you feel you are the Awesome-est
6. Beat the game

At it's core, it's pretty simple. There are gameplay elements scattered throughout those 6 steps, but they aren't important to the basic structure of the game. 

Destiny revolves around single missions that take from 10 minutes to an hour to complete. Even raids can be completed in under an hour. As long as those missions (step 2) are entertaining and fun, Destiny as a whole is fun.

Generally, those missions are fun to complete. It feels great to punch dudes, shoot things, and work as a team; shooting a rocket off at the last second to distract an enemy while you revive a teammate&mdash;awesome.

Playing Destiny is quick. I can choose to drop into the game knowing I have a limited amount of time to play and complete a couple missions.


## Steps to doing other RPGs

1. Start the game
2. Find out that an evil corporation is evil
3. Resolve to stop evil corporation
4. Find out there is an evil dude that is evil-er than evil corporation
5. Resolve to stop that evil dude
6. Find out that you might not be a person, but a man-made constructed person based off of the evil dude's mom's DNA
7. Solve your own existential crisis.
8. Complete all side-quests so you can obliterate the evil dude in ONE TURN
9. Beat the game

## So what's your reason?

Why do I still play Destiny? It's simple:

**I don't have to invest emotional sympathy with characters or put too much thought into themes the game is trying to convey.**

I don't have to care that _my Ghost found me specifically_, that I'm someone special in this world full of wicked beings and terrible monsters. 

I don't have to care that the rest of the human race is depending on me being something _more than human_, to cast aside my wants and needs and sacrifice my life so that other families living in terror in the last city on Earth can sleep well at night.

All I have to care about is if I have enough heavy ammo so I can shoot _all of the rockets at the bad dudes_ and if I have my special ability ready to go so I can self-revive during a cricial point in the mission.

And that's ok! Not every game needs to have a sweeping story, engaging characters, emotional turmoil and struggle&mdash;to be a *work of art*. Some games are best suited to just being games. 

Take Destiny for what it is: a game about _shootin'_ stuff and _punchin'_ dudes. 

If you want to dive into the lore of why the Traveler, in all his wonder and technological advancement, decided to come to the Earth, or the reason why cybernetic beings with the technology to control the flow of time (some may say...Time...Lords?) absolutely detest organic beings, then go read the [Grimoire]() that Bungie has made available online. It's full of _**absolutely amazing**_ stories and background to every aspect of the greater Destiny Universe (seriously, it's got really awesome stories).

It is when I look at Destiny and expect the depth and fidelity of those _"other RPGs"_ that I am met with frustration. However, when I play a few missions (particularly the weekly missions or raid) with friends I find that secretly I'm _having a blast_, and so are the people I'm play with:

> "Yeah! I got a critical hit with my throwing knife! Take that Atheon" -- While waiting to be teleported during the final boss fight in Vault of Glass

I still play Destiny because it's a fun game and getting frustrated at not getting new gear quick enough or having network problems while raiding is part of that "fun" too.

The difference is that
