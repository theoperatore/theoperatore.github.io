Rogue Legacy has been released for some time now, but I've only just been able to play it. It's been applauded for it's merging of RPG progression with Rogue-like procedurally generated content and experiences.

However, that's not what I want to talk about. All that stuff is cool and makes for a fun game, but what really makes this game **_awesome_** for me are the Remix Bosses.

That's what I want to talk about. There are 5 in total and they're totally bad dudes...

**Spoiler Alert**: If you don't know or want to know what the remix bosses are, then don't read the rest of this article. It's chock-full of secret stuff that you'll experience naturally as you play the game. So go play it...and exerience it yourself.

Ok, that's out of the way. Now I can talk about the 5 most challenging platforming / action-adventure / puzzle bosses I've ever played.

### Remix means different right?

about how the remix bosses are different than the normal versions because you're locked into the traits you have. Normal bosses you fit the traits to the boss to give you the best advantage. You don't have that luxury in the remix bosses. You have to make what you have been given work in the situation you're put in; Find a solution to a problem given a finite set of tools.

### Each Boss has a different strategy
