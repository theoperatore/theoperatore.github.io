# Hosted Web Projects

Here follows a list of my web apps, their sources, and a short description! Hooray!

## Chimera

A D&amp;D Digital Character Sheet. Currently only supports 4th edition, hopefully soon to have a 5th edition sheet as well. Uses React.js and soon to use Firebase with real-time stat tracking, snapshots, and other features to help make your life easier so you can focus more on the campaign.

## Triangulate

Made to help my sister track rehabilitated Red Hawks. Hooks into the Google Maps API to allow for easy triangulation and data computations.

## Bookprint

Upload any text file. Based on the parts of speech, see a unique image based on the uploaded text.

## Pixelatore

Lightning fast pixelation of any image!

## Super Party Horse 

My first take on a javascript html5 game. You control a donkey and help protect the helpless cows from getting eaten by the relentless jaguars.
